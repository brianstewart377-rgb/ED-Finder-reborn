# ED-Finder (reborn)

A colonisation helper for Elite Dangerous, built for one invite-only group of
10–20 commanders (usually 2–3 online at once), served from a Raspberry Pi at
home.

The journey is **Find → Look up → Plan → Haul**, with BGS alongside and the
galaxy map underneath. The full plan is in
[`docs/plan-2026-11-08.pdf`](docs/plan-2026-11-08.pdf).

## Where this came from

This repo was copied from the parts of
[`ed-finder`](https://github.com/brianstewart377-rgb/ed-finder) that work, at
commit `8f4d395` (9 November 2026). The old repo is kept read-only as
reference: its history, PRs and research stay there.

## What's here

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | The app: SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5, TypeScript. Babylon.js draws the maps. |
| `apps/api` | The API: Python 3.14, FastAPI, asyncpg. |
| `apps/importer` | Loads the Spansh galaxy dumps into PostgreSQL. |
| `apps/eddn_v3` | The live EDDN listener (written, not yet switched on). |
| `packages` | Shared TypeScript: the generated API client and planner core. |
| `shared_contracts` | Shared Python used by the API and importer. |
| `sql/v3` | Database migrations. |
| `sql/measure` | Read-only scripts that report on the database. |
| `tests` | Python tests for the importer and the database loaders. |
| `assets` | Asset provenance records. |

`docker-compose.yml` and `env.example` are copied unchanged from the old
server. They get cut down for the Pi during the move.

## System state: population, factions and claims

The `v3_state` tables hold the latest picture of every system that has a
population or a station: population, government, economy, factions, Powerplay
and which kinds of station are there (including colonisation construction
sites). Find uses them to tell inhabited, being-colonised and free systems
apart. They are a snapshot, not a history.

- Tables and the merge function: `sql/v3/migrations/024_v3_system_state.sql`
- Loader: `apps/importer/src/spansh_system_state.py` (Python standard library
  only). It reads Spansh's `galaxy_stations.json.gz` and writes a psql script:

```bash
python3 apps/importer/src/spansh_system_state.py --snapshot galaxy_stations.json.gz | psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 "$DATABASE_URL"
```

A load is one transaction. If the file is cut off or anything fails, nothing
changes. A newer record always wins over an older one.

## Running the Python tests

```bash
python -m pip install -r tests/requirements-ci.txt
python -m pytest -q tests
```

The database tests need `SYSTEM_STATE_TEST_DSN` pointing at a throwaway
PostgreSQL database whose name ends in `_test`. CI runs them on PostgreSQL 18.

## Checking the web app

Run these in `apps/web`:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
pnpm test
pnpm build
```
